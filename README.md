A Hangman game in Python is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a secret word by suggesting letters. The game starts with the word hidden, represented by underscores. The player inputs one letter at a time, and if the guess is correct, the letter is revealed in its correct position. If the guess is wrong, the player loses a life. The game continues until the player either guesses the word or runs out of lives. It involves basic Python concepts like loops, conditionals, and string operations.
